# UAB Sveikata - Weekly Exercise Plan Generator

A Streamlit web application that generates personalized weekly exercise plans using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model. The app takes into account user's age, fitness goals, available time, and health conditions to recommend safe and effective exercise routines.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses OpenAI API to generate personalized exercise plans
- 💪 **Flexible Goals**: Support for "Lose weight" and "Gain muscle" fitness objectives
- 🏥 **Health Awareness**: Considers known health issues when creating plans
- ⏱️ **Time-Based Planning**: Tailors recommendations to available daily exercise time
- 🔒 **Privacy-Focused**: API key is never stored, required per session
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Ensures data quality and rejects unrelated topics
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
```bash
cd /path/to/exercise-agent
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

### Start the Streamlit Server
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the App
1. Enter your OpenAI API key (kept secure, not stored)
2. Fill in your information:
   - **Age**: Your current age (1-120)
   - **Minutes per day**: How much time you can exercise daily (5-240 minutes)
   - **Goal**: Select either "Lose weight" or "Gain muscle"
   - **Health issues**: Optional field for describing relevant health conditions
3. Click "🚀 Generate My Exercise Plan"
4. Review your personalized weekly exercise plan

## Input Validation

The app includes safety features:
- **Age validation**: Must be a number between 1 and 120
- **Time validation**: Must be at least 5 minutes per day
- **Goal validation**: Only allows predefined goals
- **Topic filtering**: Rejects unrelated topics (e.g., cars, crypto, politics) to keep responses relevant

## API Requirements

- **OpenAI Account**: Required for API key
- **Model**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective model)
- **Credits**: API usage is billed based on tokens consumed

## Troubleshooting

### "Import streamlit could not be resolved"
- Ensure you've installed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify your virtual environment is activated

### "Invalid API key"
- Check that your OpenAI API key is correct
- Ensure your account has available credits
- Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to verify

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- OpenAI has rate limits on API calls
- Wait a few moments before making another request
- Check your account usage at [platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)

## Reflection

### What Was Done

This project successfully implements a complete Streamlit application for personalized exercise planning using OpenAI's API. The key accomplishments include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Built a clean, intuitive Streamlit UI with organized sections for API configuration, user information input, and plan display.

2. **Robust Input Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation for:
   - Numeric inputs (age, exercise time)
   - Dropdown selection for goals
   - Topic filtering to reject unrelated discussions

3. **Secure API Integration**: Integrated OpenAI API with proper error handling and temporary API key input (not persistent storage).

4. **Compliance with Requirements**: Ensured all responses include:
   - Required opening: "UAB Sveikata agent here…"
   - Required closing: "This answer was generated by AI and is not professional medical advice."

5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Used only two external packages (Streamlit and OpenAI) plus their transitive dependencies, avoiding bloat.

### Possible Improvements

1. **User History**: Add optional SQLite database to save past recommendations (with user consent).

2. **Authentication**: Implement user accounts and store API keys securely using environment variables or encrypted storage.

3. **Plan Customization**: Allow users to modify generated plans with feedback (e.g., "make it less intense") and regenerate.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Add ability to upload workout logs and adjust recommendations based on actual progress.

5. **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the app to support multiple languages given the "Sveikata" (Lithuanian) branding.

6. **Advanced Health Assessment**: Implement a more detailed health questionnaire using dynamic form fields.

7. **Export Functionality**: Allow users to download plans as PDF or share via email.

8. **Cost Estimation**: Display estimated API costs before generating plans to help users budget.

9. **Fallback Models**: If GPT-4o-mini is unavailable, automatically fall back to GPT-3.5-turbo.

10. **Caching**: Implement caching for identical requests to reduce API costs.

11. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add charts/visualizations for exercise distribution across the week.

12. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls.
